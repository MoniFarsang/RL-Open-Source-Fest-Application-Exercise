# RL-Open-Source-Fest-Application-Exercise
This repo contains my completed pre-screening exercise for the Reinforcement Learning Open Source Fest 2021.
> ## Python / Data Science Exercise
> Analysis how non-stationarity affects different Contextual Bandit algorithms

>> Changing the reward distribution over time and adding varying noise

>> Comparing the results of different exploration algorithms

> My code in based on the Simulating Content Personalization with Contextual Bandits Vowpal Wabbit tutorial  https://vowpalwabbit.org/tutorials/cb_simulation.html.
